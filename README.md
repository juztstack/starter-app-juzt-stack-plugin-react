# Starter template for React Application

This Concept is to implement a complete React app on a WordPress website that can be loaded from a specified path, for example, `/buy`. From there, other routes can be loaded using React Router Dom and React components.

To modify the default path base, only change the constant named `MY_REACT_APP_BASEPATH`, and if you need to have more than one app, if is need to change the query param key on the constant name `MY_REACT_APP_QUERY_PARAM` for this refresh rewrite rules.
